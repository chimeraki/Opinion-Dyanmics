# Opinion-Dyanmics
Social dynamics in a simulated controlled population where interacting individuals have a spectrum of opinions 


Each individual has opinions that vary on a scale, trust factor (how much other people trust them), credibility, popularity. Individuals interact with each other and long time-scale social dynamics, dissemination of opinion and formation of social cliques are observed. 

Upon interaction between two people, their opinions change by a degree that depends on their relative credibility, popularity, and trust factor.
